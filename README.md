# My Supply Chain Experience
I had the privilege to work for the number one restaurant chain in the world with 34,000 restaurants, an iconic fast food American brand having operations in 119 countries. Gartner listed its supply chain solution as one of the top 3 and I happen to be one of the Subject Matter Expert helping them for years. In this README I have gathered my learnings on many of the Advanced Supply Chain solutions and concepts  

# Supply Planning Concepts 

## Supply Chain Network
The end goal is to supply items to  restaurants, in order to fulfill this there are many entities involved based on the item. Most of these entities are independently operated (called as Owner Operators). Local and Forign suppliers who mamanufacture or produce items. Hubs are the locations where items are gathered before its redistributed. Master Warehouses which store huge volumns of in-transit inventory. Distribution Center who work closely with Restaurant Owner Operators for day to day distribution of items. 

Each one of these entities need to plan supply for its demand. Demand, Supply and Transportation planning systems are involved at each entity level.
